# Sales Ledger Management System - Functional Documentation

## Executive Summary

The Sales Ledger Management System is a comprehensive customer account management subsystem within the ACAS (Applewood Computers Accounting System) suite. It manages all aspects of customer relationships, including customer master data, sales transactions, invoicing, credit control, payment processing, and customer statements. The system consists of 36 COBOL programs that work together to provide full sales ledger functionality, supporting both traditional file-based and modern relational database backends.

## Business Rules Engine

### Credit Management Rules
1. **Credit Limit Enforcement**
   - New orders checked against available credit
   - Credit = Limit - Current Balance - Unallocated
   - Override requires authorization code

2. **Payment Terms**
   - Standard terms from customer master
   - Invoice due date = Invoice date + Credit days
   - Late charges applied after grace period

3. **Discount Calculation**
   - Customer discount % applied to invoice lines
   - Early payment discounts tracked separately
   - Discount validation against authorization limits

### Accounting Rules
1. **Invoice Posting**
   - Debit: Customer Account (Sales Ledger)
   - Credit: Sales Account (by product category)
   - Credit: Tax Account (VAT/Sales Tax)

2. **Payment Application**
   - FIFO allocation to oldest invoices first
   - Partial payments allowed with tracking
   - Unapplied amounts held in suspense

3. **Period Closing**
   - No backdated transactions after period close
   - Automatic rollover of balances
   - Audit trail preservation

### Validation Rules
1. **Customer Code**: 6 characters + check digit validation
2. **Date Validation**: Business date range checks
3. **Amount Validation**: Positive amounts, decimal precision
4. **Reference Uniqueness**: Invoice numbers must be unique
