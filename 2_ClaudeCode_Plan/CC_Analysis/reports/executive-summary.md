## Overview

This report presents the results of an evidence-based COBOL code analysis performed on the source code located at:
`/Users/MartinGonella/Desktop/Demos/ACAS`

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Files Discovered | 443 |
| Successfully Parsed | 443 |
| Failed to Parse | 0 |
| Parse Success Rate | 100.0% |
| Average McCabe Complexity | 39.6 |
| Total Lines of Code | 212,527 |

## Validation Summary

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Total Validations | 2 |
| Passed | 2 |
| Failed | 0 |
| Success Rate | 100.0% |

## Analysis Approach

This analysis used:
- **GnuCOBOL v3.2.0** for syntax validation
- **Single-pass parsing** for consistency
- **Evidence-based metrics** calculated from AST
- **Comprehensive validation** at every step

## Key Findings

1. **Code Quality**: Average complexity of 39.6 indicates moderate complexity
2. **Parse Success**: 100.0% success rate indicates well-formed code
3. **Validation**: 100.0% validation success confirms high data quality

## Recommendations

1. **Refactoring**: High average complexity (39.6) with 29.1% of programs having McCabe > 50 suggests significant refactoring opportunities
2. **Focus Areas**: Prioritize refactoring for sl910 (McCabe 401), gl030 (361), xl150 (344), and st030 (342)
3. **Monitoring**: Set up regular analysis runs to track complexity trends
