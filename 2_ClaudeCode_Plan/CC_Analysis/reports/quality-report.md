# Code Quality Report

## Analysis Quality Metrics

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Parse Success Rate | 100.0% | ✅ |
| Validation Success | 100.0% | ✅ |
| Data Consistency | 2 checkpoints | ✅ |

## Validation Details

All validations passed successfully.

## Known Limitations

1. External program calls (CBL_*, SYSTEM, etc.) are identified but not analyzed
2. Embedded SQL and CICS statements are detected but not parsed in detail
3. Copybook contents are not expanded during analysis
4. Dynamic CALL targets cannot be resolved

## Data Quality Assurance

All metrics in this analysis are:
- ✅ Calculated from parsed AST data
- ✅ Validated for consistency
- ✅ Traceable to source code
- ✅ Free from estimates or approximations

## Methodology

This analysis used a single parsing methodology throughout:
1. GnuCOBOL syntax validation
2. AST generation with comprehensive extraction
3. Single-point metric calculation
4. Validation at every step

No recalculation or reinterpretation of metrics occurred after initial parsing.
