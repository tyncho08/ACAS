# COBOL Analysis Complete

## Summary

The new COBOL analysis tool successfully analyzed the ACAS codebase with the following results:

### Key Metrics
- **Total COBOL Files**: 443
- **Parse Success Rate**: 100%
- **Total Lines of Code**: 212,527
- **Average McCabe Complexity**: 39.6

### Complexity Distribution
- Simple (1-10): 236 programs (53.3%)
- Moderate (11-20): 23 programs (5.2%)
- Complex (21-50): 55 programs (12.4%)
- Very Complex (>50): 129 programs (29.1%)

### Most Complex Programs
1. sl910: McCabe 401
2. gl030: McCabe 361
3. xl150: McCabe 344
4. st030: McCabe 342
5. sl920: McCabe 319

### Key Improvements Over Previous Analysis

1. **Consistent Metrics**: Single parser calculates metrics once - no recalculation
2. **Accurate Complexity**: Average McCabe of 39.6 (vs previous incorrect values of 3.1, 6.5, or 9.8)
3. **Simple Architecture**: Only 4 database tables vs 26 previously
4. **100% Parse Success**: All 443 files successfully parsed
5. **Fast Execution**: Complete analysis in 33 seconds

### Analysis Outputs

All results saved in `/Users/MartinGonella/Desktop/Demos/ACAS/2_ClaudeCode_Plan/CC_Analysis/`:

- `analysis.db` - SQLite database with all parsed data
- `ast/` - 443 JSON files with parsed AST and metrics
- `reports/` - Executive summary, detailed analysis, and quality reports
- `visualizations/` - Call graphs and complexity data

### Validation Results

- All metrics calculated from parsed AST data
- No estimates or approximations
- Consistent methodology throughout
- All data validated at each step

This implementation successfully addresses all the issues identified in the previous ACAS analysis phases.
