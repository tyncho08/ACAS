# Methodology Consistency Fix - Final Resolution

**Date**: September 15, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED  

---

## Summary of the Issue

Phase 3 was **recalculating** McCabe complexity using a different algorithm instead of using the values already calculated and stored in the AST during Phase 1.

---

## Root Cause

### Phase 1 (deep_cobol_parser.js)
```javascript
// Correctly incremented McCabe for:
result.complexity.mccabe++; // CALL statements
result.complexity.mccabe++; // IF conditions  
result.complexity.mccabe += whenCount; // EVALUATE branches
```

### Phase 3 (phase3_metrics_calculator.js) - ORIGINAL PROBLEM
```javascript
calculateMcCabeComplexity(ast) {
    // Was RECALCULATING from scratch, ignoring ast.complexity.mccabe
    let complexity = 1;
    // Only counted businessLogic conditions, missing CALLs
}
```

### Phase 3 (FIXED)
```javascript
getMcCabeComplexity(ast) {
    // Now correctly uses the AST value from Phase 1
    if (ast.complexity && ast.complexity.mccabe !== undefined) {
        return { value: ast.complexity.mccabe, ... };
    }
}
```

## Impact of the Fix

### Before Fix
- Average McCabe: 3.1 (incorrect recalculation)
- plautogenMT: 8 (missing 37 CALL statements)
- Inconsistent methodology between phases

### After Fix  
- Average McCabe: **9.8** (correct AST values)
- plautogenMT: **45** (includes all control flow)
- Consistent methodology throughout

---

## Verification

```bash
# AST file has correct value
ast.complexity.mccabe = 45

# Database has correct value  
SELECT mccabe_complexity FROM programs WHERE program_id = 'plautogenMT'
→ 45

# New metrics report has correct value
grep plautogenMT phase3_metrics/metrics_report.json
→ "value": 45
```

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Always use the AST as the authoritative source
2. **No Recalculation**: Once calculated, reuse values consistently
3. **Validation Required**: Cross-check values between phases
4. **Documentation Critical**: Document calculation methodology clearly

---

## Final Status

✅ **Issue completely resolved**  
✅ **All reports updated with correct values**  
✅ **Methodology now consistent across all phases**  
✅ **Average McCabe complexity: 9.8**

The ACAS analysis now uses a single, consistent methodology for complexity calculation throughout all phases.
