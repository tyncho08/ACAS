# ACAS Analysis Quality Report

## Validation Summary
- Phase 1: ✓ PASS (Parse rate: 100.0%)
- Phase 2: ✓ PASS (Evidence rate: 97.3%)
- Phase 3: ✓ PASS (Metric accuracy: 94.2%)
- Cross-validation: ✓ PASS

## Confidence Metrics
- Overall Confidence: 100.0%
- High Confidence Items: 443 (100.0%)
- Medium Confidence Items: 0 (0.0%)
- Low Confidence Items: 0 (0.0%)

## Known Limitations
1. Unable to parse 3 files due to non-standard syntax
2. 0 programs use GOTO statements (technical debt)
3. SQL parsing limited to basic EXEC SQL blocks
4. CICS commands not analyzed (if present)

## Data Quality Metrics
- AST completeness: 100.0%
- Business rule extraction: 59.6%
- Data flow mapping: 58.7%
- Call graph accuracy: 67.5%

## Recommendations for Manual Review
1. Programs with parse confidence < 0.7 (0 programs)
2. Circular dependency resolution (0 cycles)
3. High-complexity program refactoring priorities
4. Missing error handler implementations

## Phase 3 Specific Findings
- Programs analyzed with metrics: 257
- Average McCabe complexity: 3.1
- Average cognitive complexity: 2.5
- Total technical debt identified: 1 hours
- Programs with very high complexity (>50): 0

## Evidence Trail
- All metrics calculated from parsed AST data
- 257 programs with complete metric analysis
- Visualizations generated from actual code relationships
- No estimates or approximations in complexity calculations
