## Rules

- Always execute phases strictly in order (Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3).  
- Never mark a checklist item until its corresponding phase has been executed.  
- Always save the updated checklist after each phase.  
- If something cannot be done, explain the reason in the report and continue.
